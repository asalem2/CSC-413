# SWING GUI CALCULATOR

As shown in class, you can use the code on the slide as a starting point. Add 4 more buttons for
parenthesizes, C (for clear one character), CE (for clearing thewhole calculation).
For 20 buttons, you should use for loop. Donâ€™t handle buttons one by one.
Once the GUI part is done, then what was read in from the textfield will be used as input to
Evaluator class. The output from the Evaluator will be written back to textfield.
