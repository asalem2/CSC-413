# CSC 413 Term Project 

Software Reusability Practices reading given Wingman game and then develop a Tank Multiplayer
Games Development and another game from Game Maker’s Apprentice Book Chapters
(Spring 2015)

* 1st milestone (Tank Game Basic part) due by 4/13 11:59 pm [5 points]

* 2nd milestone (Tank Game Complete) due by 4/20 11:59 pm [20 points]

* 3rd milestone (Design Doc of the game of your own selection from GameMaker’s Apprentice
Book) due by 4/27 11:59 pm [5 points]

* 4th milestone (Complete game of your own selection from GameMaker’s Apprentice Book) due
by 5/4 11:59 pm [20 points]

* 5th milestone (Class presentation with power point slides on 5/5 & 5/12 – the order of
presentation will be random using lottery system. Everyone should be ready to present using their
submitted code) [5 points]

* 6th milestone (Documentation of both games, their reusability, self-reflection on software design
and development)

You are recommended to study Game Maker version of Wingman and Tank games and the given source
code of Wingman game. This will help you understand the game mechanics needed to make the 2D
sprite-based games. Lecture slides contain the steps to make those games and explain how resources are
controlled in the “Object” and the “Objects” listen to events and actions are set up accordingly. By
comparing two games, you should create proper super classes that can handle common tasks in abstract
level and then sub classes will handle specific tasks.

Design of these classes has to be clearly explained. You need to list all the classes that will be used in
your games. Each class should include important states and behaviors. Inheritance relationship should be
clearly specified. Also the classes that are reused at both games should be color-coded!

Requirement for Tank game:

Grading Criteria includes
*  Smooth Performance and pleasant user experience (score, background music, etc) – 7 points
*  Tank angle & moving direction handling – 3 points
* Mini-map – 2 points
*  Collision with wall, bullet, other items – 3 points
*  Viewing Window - 2 points
*  Explosion effect – 1 point (Tank & blocks – disappearing and appearing over time)
*  Health, Life and Bonus – 2 points

Grading Criteria for 2nd game of your own choice
* Smooth Performance and pleasant user experience (score, background music, etc) – 10 points
* Specific feature of the game highlighted by the book – 10 points
* Reusability and clean design of the game – 5 points [design doc] + 3 points [final doc]
